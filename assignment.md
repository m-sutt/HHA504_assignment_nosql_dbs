## Start and Configure DB

1. Navigate to BiQuery (GCP)
2. Create Dataset (create table)

## Reflections

- GCP BigQuery was relatively straightforward. May be due to my familiarization of the platform. SQL queries was also striaghtforward and easily connected.
- MongoDB Atlas: had a little tough time navigating it initially but with time it may be easier to use than GCP. MongoDB Atlas provided a No-SQL environment where I could store and query JSON-like documents. The Atlas setup process was easy. Overall a very friendly UI. The change to JSON was intersting.
- Redis Cloud was the hardest of the three since I am not all that familiar with its interface. Still a very modern UI/UX which helps. The setup process is mostly harder of the three but if given time it might be easier than GCP. Could not get the insert and mody key-value pairs of the assignment.
